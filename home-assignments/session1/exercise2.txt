1.
Write a python program, that checks your location according to your IP.
Then checks the current weather at your location and writes the result to a file in a regular text format.

2. 
In that same program, create a list with at least 10 cities,
And print their current weather in the following format:
â€œThe weather in <city>, <country>(full country name) is XX degrees.

location_by_ip_api = 'http://ip-api.com/json'
weather_api = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city},{country}&APPID=9c8b160816fc48b0288a6136e0989b2a'
